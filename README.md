Some Jupyter notebooks for stable diffusion
Use them in Google Colab if you need a fast dedicated GPU and you don't know where to get one.

I've disabled the NSFW filter because it gives false posetives and refuses to show a lot of images.

it has it's own 
[community terms](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL).
